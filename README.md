# Password storage demo

As part of my Software Security classes, I want to do a live demo of different
password storage algorithms:

* Hashing: MD5, SHA1, SHA256
* Key Derivation Functions: BCrypt

## Setup

You need Python 2 for this. Python 3 support is unstable.
Install the packages (ideally, inside a virtualenv) using:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the demo

Now, run the demo using the following command:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

A web server will start locally, and browser window will open, showing a list of
Notebooks. Click on __algorithms.ipynb__ and you will be at the demo.
