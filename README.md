# Password storage demo

As part of my Software Security classes, I want to do a live demo of different
password storage algorithms:

* Hashing: MD5, SHA1, SHA256
* Key Derivation Functions: BCrypt

## Setup

You need Python and [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for this.

## Run the demo

Now, run the demo using the following commands:

```shell
pipenv shell
jupyter notebook
```

A web server will start locally, and browser window will open, showing a list of
Notebooks. Click on __algorithms.ipynb__ and you will be at the demo.
